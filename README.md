This system is for people who are processing shipping invoices for deliveries of parts from numerous vendors all over the world. This particular company typically receives over 20 such shipments per day. Because of how the forwarders bill, the invoice processors must know many details of the shipments and deliveries. This info generally comes across as a steady stream of emails. The basic function of IncomingShipments is to organize this jumble of emails by Shipping Tracking Number (HBL), Container Number, Shipping Form Number (the document initiating a shipment) and Invoice Number.
